# Raytracing

> c++ raytracing from scratch

![sphere plane](example.png)

This program generates a ray-traced image using basic c++ stl libraries. Scenes are loaded from a text-based file-format using a python script to interpret the protocol and help the c++ program parse the input. This program is capable of outputting images to the PPM file-format, from which another program can be used to convert to other, modern formats such as PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc. Future plans include expansion to support BMP output.

## Installation/Operation

The compilation using `clang` is controlled through `make`.

### Dependencies

-   `clang`
-   `make`
-   `doxygen`
-   `python3`

### Commands

On UNIX based systems, the program can be compiled by running

```shell
make
```

and executed with

```shell
./raytracing input_file.scene.stream output_file.ppm
```
A `*.scene` file can be formatted to the `*.scene.stream` file through
```shell
python3 scene.py file_name.scene
```

The documentation can be generated by running

```shell
doxygen Doxyfile
```
